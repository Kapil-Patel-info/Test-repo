# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website made using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It has 3 main sections:

- **About Me** – a short intro about myself.  
- **Projects** – some sample projects I added.  
- **Contact** – my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links.  

The design is simple with a header, navigation bar, and footer.  
I made this to practice web development and showcase my work.
